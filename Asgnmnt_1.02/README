Load and Save functionality
	This version of dungeonGenerator implements load and save features for dungeons. The player
	can load previously saved dungeons by calling : ./dungeonGenerator --load after compiling.
	The player can also save a generated dungeon in the same way by calling --save instead of load,
	this call will generate a dungeon, then write it to the save location. The save file is  
	locted in ~/.rlg327/dungeon. PC location data has also been added and is stored in the 
	Dungeon struct as Dungeon.PC. PC is of type struct Coordinate and stores the coordinates of
	the current play position. Code now prints the Player character, sets PC to be the first position        in the first room.

Load/Save algorithm:
	1.) Check command line for switches
		a.) if switch == --load
			-load the dungeon
		b.) else 
			-generate new dungeon
		c.) if switch == --save 
			-write current dungeon

General Notes
	-Known Bug: Code might overwrite dungeon save file when loading new file, need to check logic
         of calling --load <file>
