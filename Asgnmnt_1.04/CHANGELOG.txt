(9/7) Cloned git repo : https://github.com/wasartin/rogueLikeGame to make use of another students finished Dungeon Generation algorithm
(9/10) added functions load() save() and begin implementation of the two methods
(9/11) added code to main method to scan input for load and save switches
(9/11) Working on reading and parsing file
(9/11) Filled in main to scan for switches and handle them
(9/12) Filled in all but last read block of load() function
(9/13) Fixed all but last read block
(9/13) Fixed load method, now having seg fault in main method while checking for switches
(9/13) Added print statements to find bug in main, unsuccessful so far
(9/14) Added final block of load function, getting unknown seg fault
(9/14) Went to help room and Ibrahim Mesecan helped find seg fault
(9/14) New seg fault when running fillMap(d, room)
(9/14) Fixed seg fault, load now works as expected
(9/14) Began implementing save, filled in first 4 write blocks
(9/15) Finished save, implemented fillMap to fill in player character, updated README
(9/15) Noticed possible bug, when calling load on a specific file, the code might overwrite 
the current dungeon save file.
(9/16) Created Assignment 1.03 repo on local machine to begin working on assignment 1.03
(9/21) Created dijkstra_non_tunnel and dijkstra_tunnel functions for filling the distances of each map
(9/21) Created structs for non tunneling, and tunneling. Used for distance calculations, based off Professors corridor path struct
(9/22) Began implementing dijkstral_non_tunnel with reference to Professors dijkstra corridor function
(9/25) Finished dijkstra_non_tunnel, have a bug where it is printing only 0s. not sure where the fault
is.
(9/29) Did not finish dikstra for distances before due date, cloning professors code and implementing it into my solution. Fixed code formating to fit my style. Abandon ship, RIP dungeonGenerator v0.4.2
(9/30) Filled in structs for monsters, events, and added event type to PC struct. Added variables in dungeon to store number of monsters and array of monsters. Added method gen_monsters to generate given number of monsters.
(9/30) Added checks for --nummon switch
(10/1) Added new_event function, get_room function. Filled in get_room, began work on implementing gen_monsters and new_event. Need to figure out how to use events.
(10/2) Added check statement to see if there is a character at some given position, currently it is broken, need to cast to int.
(10/2) implemented gen_monsters, should be done.
(10/3) Code almost done, need to fix gen_monsters so it is not putting monsters on top of each other, fixed new event, removed event variable from character struct
(10/4) Finished rough version of 1.04, not completely implemented but working.
