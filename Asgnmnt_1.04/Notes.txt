Notes:

Need to add implementation for monsters. Define default number of mosters, add code to scan for 
--nummon switch to input an int number of monsters into the dungeon.
Monster:
  - Can have characteritics assigned at random, monsters have 50% chance of each:
     - Intelligence: understand dungeon layout, move on shortest path toward PC. Unintelligent move in
                  straight line towards PC. Can also remember last known position of a previously seen PC

     - Telepathy: Always know where the PC is. Not Telepathy monsters only know the position of PC if
                  they have line of sight (or can remember last known position). No TP only move where
                  they remember the PC being or when they have direct sight of PC

     - Tunneling: can tunnel through rock. Tunneling monsters when attempting to move
                  through rock will subtract 85 from its hardness, down to a minimum of zero. When the 
                  hardness reaches zero, the rock becomes corridor and the monster immediately moves. 
                  Reducing the hardness of rock forces a tunneling distance map recalculation. Converting                  rock to corridor forces tunneling and non-tunneling distance map recalculations.

     - Erratic: Have a 50% chance of moving as per other characteristics, otherwise they move to random
                neighboring cell.


  - Store the characteristics of a monster as hexidecimal digits, with 4 bits representing the 
  characteristic of some given monster. 
  - Each monster gets speed between 5 and 20. PC gets speed of 10. 
    - Every character generates an event when it is created. The event has a time, when it will occur 
      (based on character speed and current time), and goes in a priority queue, prioritized on the 
      event time.

  -Discrete Event Simulator
 
  -Need to figure out how to implement events
  -Need priority queue
  -Monsters move away first, figure out problem
