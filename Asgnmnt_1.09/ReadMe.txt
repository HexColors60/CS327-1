This iteration adds funcitonality for PC inventory and object pickup. Pickup is not automatic,
the PC can trigger an item pickup by pressing ','. PC carry inventory works, but I could 
not get the equipment inventory to print so I have not implemented that or wearing/taking off items.
Did not have time to do damage system updates. This one sucked.
