This iteration adds funcitonality for PC inventory and object pickup. 
I have changed the description code to only allow object names with a of max
number of characters, makes printing object names easier. Max length of object
name is x. Pickup items by pressing ',' (or something).

Refactor_carry jumbles arround the order of carry, not sure if that is an issue yet

Speed boosts? How do we do that...
